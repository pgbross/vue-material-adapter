# Material Components for Vue

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pgbross/vue-material-adapter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pgbross/vue-material-adapter)

[vue-material-adapter](https://github.com/pgbross/vue-material-adapter) is an integration of
[Material Web Components](https://material.io/components/web/)
and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) which uses the
[`Using Foundations and Adapters`](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/docs/integrating-into-frameworks.md#the-advanced-approach-using-foundations-and-adapters) integration technique.

This project defines Vue components that use the `Material Components Web` library to implement Material Design.mization while sticking to the _Vue Spirit_ (approachable, versatile, and performant)
